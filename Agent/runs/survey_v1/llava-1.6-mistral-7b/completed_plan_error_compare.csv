 The image shows a screenshot of an online survey questionnaire. The questions are as follows:

1. Trust coverage - A checkbox question with radio buttons labeled 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Neutral', 'Agree', and 'Strongly agree'.
2. Mood impact - Similar to the first question, this is another checkbox question asking about the impact of the Olympics on one's mood.
3. Age - A fill-in-the-blank text field where participants are expected to enter their age.
4. Follow by age - A select dropdown with options 'Very closely', 'Somewhat', 'Only highlights', 'Not much', and an empty 'Select...' option.
5. Employment status - Another select dropdown question with options 'Student', 'Full-time', 'Part-time', 'Self-employed', and 'Not currently working'.
6. Watch time - A slider question asking for the amount of time spent daily on Olympics content, with a range from 1 to 10 hours.
7. Attention text_mid - A select dropdown question with options 'Very closely', 'Somewhat', 'Only highlights', 'Not much', and an empty 'Select...' option.
8. Country satisfaction - A slider question asking for satisfaction with one's country's Olympic performance, with a range from 1 to 10.
9. Future interest - A select dropdown question with options 'Very likely', 'Likely', 'Unsure', 'Unlikely', and an empty 'Select...' option.
10. Favorite moment - A fill-in-the-blank text field where participants are expected to describe their favorite Olympic moment.
11. Next - A button that presumably leads to the next page of the survey.

The survey is partially completed, as indicated by the blue checkmarks next to questions 3, 5, and 6. It appears that the participant has selected 'Full-time' for employment status, 'Somewhat' for attention text_mid, and 'Very likely' for future interest. The age field is not filled in, and the watch time slider is set to 1 hour. The survey also contains a section titled 'Olympic Survey', which seems to be a placeholder or title for the survey rather than a question.

 The image appears to be a screenshot of an online survey or questionnaire. The interface is designed for user interaction with various fields such as checkboxes (for multiple-choice answers), text input fields, and radio buttons (also for multiple-choice answers). There are also sections where users can select from dropdown menus.

At the top of the image, there's a header that reads ""Instructions"" followed by some instructions in English. The survey includes questions about trust coverage, mood impact, age, employment status, and other demographic information. It also asks about the time spent watching Olympics content daily, satisfaction with the country's Olympic performance, likelihood of following the next Olympics, favorite Olympic moment, and current employment status.

The user is asked to select some options for a question about moving to the next page, which includes an option to move immediately or wait until the end of the survey. The user can also select whether they want to receive updates on the Olympics periodically, how much time they spend daily on Olympic content, and whether they agree with certain statements related to the Olympics.

The bottom part of the image shows a section where users can enter their name or email address for future communication. There's an option to agree with the terms and conditions, which includes a note about spending daily on Olympics content and a question about mood.

At the very bottom of the image, there is a ""Next"" button indicating that this is part of a multi-step survey where users can move through different pages. The interface also includes a checkbox for agreement with the terms and conditions, which seems to be a common feature in online surveys to ensure that participants have read and understood the terms before proceeding.
