The form also includes a navigation button labeled \"next\" at the bottom right corner.\n\nTo complete this survey, you would need to fill out each field according to the instructions provided in the image. Here's how you could structure your JSON array of action intents based on the visible fields and instructions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"tool\": \"click\", \"key\": \"trust_coverage\"},\n  {\"tool\": \"check\", \"key\": \"trust_coverage\", \"value\": \"Neutral\"},\n  {\"tool\": \"fill\", \"key\": \"age\", \"value\": \"30.0\"},\n  {\"tool\": \"select\", \"key\": \"employment_status\", \"value\": \"Full-time\"},\n  {\"tool\": \"set_range\", \"key\": \"watch_time\", \"value\": \"5.0\"},\n  {\"tool\": \"click\", \"key\": \"next\"}\n]\n```\n\nPlease note that the JSON array includes a sequence of actions to complete the survey: clicking on the first question, selecting a radio button for the \"trust_coverage\" question, filling in an age value, selecting \"Full-time\" as the employment status, setting a watch time value, and finally clicking the \"next\" button.\n\nRemember that this is just one possible way to complete the survey based on the visible fields and instructions. The actual actions may vary depending on your answers to each question. ",
