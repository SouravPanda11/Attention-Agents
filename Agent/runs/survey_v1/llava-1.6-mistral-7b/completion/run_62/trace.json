It has not been answered yet, as indicated by the message.\n   - \"mood_impact\" is another checkbox question with similar options. The message below it suggests that this question also needs an answer before moving forward.\n\n2. **Select Dropdown Questions:**\n   - \"follow_by_age\" is a select dropdown question, but the message indicates that it has not been answered yet.\n   - \"attention_text_mid\" is another select dropdown question with similar options as the previous one. The message below it confirms that this question also needs an answer before moving forward.\n   - \"country_satisfaction\" is a range slider question, but the message indicates that it has not been answered yet.\n   - \"future_interest\" is another select dropdown question with similar options as the previous ones. The message below it confirms that this question also needs an answer before moving forward.\n\n3. **Text Input and Range Slider Questions:**\n   - \"age\" is a text input field, but there's no indication about whether it has been answered yet or not.\n   - \"watch_time\" is a range slider question with numeric values (1 to 10), but the message indicates that it has not been answered yet.\n\n4. **Navigation Control:**\n   - The \"next\" button at the bottom right corner of the image is currently visible, suggesting that navigation controls are available for moving through the survey.\n\n5. **General Feedback:**\n   - There's a general message at the top of the image stating that the user must complete all questions before moving to the next page, which aligns with the requirement of answering all answerable items in a completion mode scenario.\n\nTo proceed with the survey, the user would need to fill out the remaining answerable fields as indicated by the messages.
