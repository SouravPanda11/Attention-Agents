To fill a field, you would select the field from the list of available tools (e.g., 'fill') and then provide the value to be entered in that field. For example, if you need to enter your age into the \"age\" field, you would use the 'fill' tool with a value between 18 and 99.\n\n2. **Select**: This tool is used for HTML select dropdowns. To select an option, you would choose the field from the list of available tools (e.g., 'select'), then specify the key of the field and the value of the selected option. For example, to select your current employment status, you would use the 'select' tool with a value corresponding to the appropriate employment status (e.g., 'student', 'full_time', 'part_time', 'self_employed', or 'not_working').\n\n3. **Check**: This tool is used for radio/checkbox groups where only one option can be selected. To check a field, you would choose the field from the list of available tools (e.g., 'check'), then specify the key of the field and the value of the selected option (either by label or by value). For example, to indicate your trust in Olympic coverage, you would use the 'check' tool with a value corresponding to your response (e.g., 'Strongly agree', 'Agree', 'Neutral', 'Disagree', or 'Strongly disagree').\n\n4. **Set_range**: This tool is used for range/slider inputs with numeric values. To set the range, you would choose the field from the list of available tools (e.g., 'set_range'), then specify the key of the field and the value to be entered in the slider or range input. For example, to indicate how much time you spent daily on Olympics content during the period, you would use the 'set_range' tool with a value between 1 and 10.\n\n5. **Click**: This tool is used for buttons, image options, and navigation controls. To click a field, you would choose the field from the list of available tools (e.g., 'click'), then specify the key of the field. For example, to move to the next page after completing the current page, you would use the 'click' tool with the key corresponding to the 'next' button.\n\n6. **Done**: This tool is used when no further actions are needed on the current page.
