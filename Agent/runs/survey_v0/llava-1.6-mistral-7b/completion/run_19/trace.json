      "VLM did not return JSON array. Raw:\n To resolve this issue, I would recommend adding a validation checkpoint that ensures all required fields are filled out before allowing navigation. This could be implemented as follows:\n\n1. After the user has answered all answerable items (mood_impact, follow_by_age, attention_text_mid, country_satisfaction, and future_interest), a checkpoint could appear prompting the user to proceed with navigation.\n\n2. The checkpoint would include clear instructions and visual cues indicating which questions still need to be answered. For example, if mood_impact is not filled out, the checkpoint could show a message saying \"Please answer question 9: 'The Olympics positively affected my day-to-day mood.' before proceeding.\"\n\n3. Once all required fields are filled out, the user can then proceed with navigation by clicking on the 'Next' button.\n\n4. To further enhance user experience, consider adding a progress bar or a visual indicator showing which questions have been answered to help guide the user through the process.\n\n5. Additionally, you may want to revisit the instructions at the top of the survey to ensure they are clear and comprehensive in guiding the user through the completion process.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you can ensure that all required fields are filled out before navigation is permitted, thus avoiding the issue of missing or invalid values for fill fields like 'age'.
