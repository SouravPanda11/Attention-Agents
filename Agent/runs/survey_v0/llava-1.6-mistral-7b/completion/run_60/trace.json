For example, if the question asks \"What is your age?\", you would use the 'fill' tool to enter your age into the field provided.\n\n2. **select**: This tool is used for HTML select dropdowns. For instance, if there's a question asking about your employment status with an option list, you would use the 'select' tool to choose one of the options from the list.\n\n3. **check**: This tool is used for radio/checkbox groups (choose one option by label or value). If there's a question asking \"Do you trust the Olympic coverage I usually consume?\", you would use the 'check' tool to select an answer from the options provided, such as \"Strongly disagree\".\n\n4. **set_range**: This tool is used for range/slider inputs with numeric values. For example, if there's a question asking about how much time you spent daily on Olympics content during the Olympics period, you would use the 'set_range' tool to move the slider to the appropriate value.\n\n5. **click**: This tool is used for buttons, image options, and navigation controls. If there's a button labeled \"Next\", you would use the 'click' tool to click on it to proceed to the next page of the survey.\n\n6. **done**: This tool is used when no further actions are needed on the current page.

Based on the information in the image, I will outline the actions that can be taken using the tools provided:\n\n1. **fill**: This tool is used for text/number input and textarea fields. For example, if the question asks \"What is your age?\", you would use the 'fill' tool to enter your age into the field provided.\n\n2. **select**: This tool is used for HTML select dropdowns. For instance, if there's a question asking about your employment status with an option list, you would use the 'select' tool to choose one of the options from the list.\n\n3. **check**: This tool is used for radio/checkbox groups (choose one option by label or value). If there's a question asking \"Do you trust the Olympic coverage I usually consume?\", you would use the 'check' tool to select an answer from the options provided, such as \"Strongly disagree\".\n\n4. **set_range**: This tool is used for range/slider inputs with numeric values. For example, if there's a question asking about how much time you spent daily on Olympics content during the Olympics period, you would use the 'set_range' tool to move the slider to the appropriate value.\n\n5. **click**: This tool is used for buttons, image options, and navigation controls. If there's a button labeled \"Next\", you would use the 'click' tool to click on it to proceed to the next page of the survey.\n\n6. **done**: This tool is used when no further actions are needed on the current page. It's typically used after all required answerable items have been completed and before clicking \"Next\" or \"Submit\".\n\nIn the image, you can see various fields such as \"trust_coverage\", \"mood_impact\", \"age\", \"follow_by_age\", \"employment_status\", \"watch_time\", \"attention_text_mid\", \"country_satisfaction\", \"future_interest\", \"favorite_moment\", and \"next\". These fields are typical of a survey form, and the actions you can take with each field correspond to the tools mentioned above.\n\nPlease note that the actual implementation of these tools would depend on the specific functionality provided by the online survey platform being used. The names of the tools (fill, select, check, set_range, click, done) are consistent with standard web-form actions and are used here for clarity. ",
