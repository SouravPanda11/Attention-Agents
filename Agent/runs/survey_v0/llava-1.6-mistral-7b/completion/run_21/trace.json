      "VLM did not return JSON array. Raw:\n To complete the survey, we need to address the following issues:\n\n1. For the \"trust_coverage\" field, which is a checkbox question, we must select an option that corresponds to how much we trust the Olympic coverage we usually consume. The correct tool for this would be 'check', with the key set to 'trust_coverage' and the value matching one of the option labels or values from the ACTION_SPACE.\n\n2. For the \"mood_impact\" field, which is also a checkbox question, we must select an option that corresponds to whether the Olympics positively affected our day-to-day mood. The correct tool for this would be 'check', with the key set to 'mood_impact' and the value matching one of the option labels or values from the ACTION_SPACE.\n\n3. For the \"age\" field, which is a fill-in-the-blank question, we need to input our age range. The correct tool for this would be 'fill', with the key set to 'age' and the value set to the appropriate numeric range between 18 and 99.\n\n4. For the \"follow_by_age\" field, which is a select question, we need to select an option that corresponds to how closely we follow the Olympics compared to people of our age group. The correct tool for this would be 'select', with the key set to 'follow_by_age' and the value matching one of the option labels or values from the ACTION_SPACE.\n\n5. For the \"employment_status\" field, which is also a select question, we need to select an option that corresponds to our current employment status. The correct tool for this would be 'select', with the key set to 'employment_status' and the value matching one of the option labels or values from the ACTION_SPACE.\n\n6. For the \"watch_time\" field, which is a slider question, we need to set the range of the slider to match the minimum and maximum values provided in the ACTION_SPACE. The correct tool for this would be 'set_range', with the key set to 'watch_time' and the value set to the appropriate numeric range between 1 and 10.\n\n7. For the \"attention_text_mid\" field, which is a select question, we need to select an option that corresponds to how satisfied we were with our country's Olympic performance. The correct tool for this would be 'select', with the key set to 'country_satisfaction' and the value matching one of the option labels or values from the ACTION_SPACE.\n\n8. For the \"favorite_moment\" field, which is a fill-in-the-blank question, we need to input a brief description of our favorite Olympic moment. The correct tool for this would be 'fill', with the key set to 'favorite_moment'.\n\nOnce these actions are performed and all required answerable items are filled in, we can click on the \"next\" button, which is a navigation control. The correct tool for this would be 'click', with the key set to 'next'. ",
