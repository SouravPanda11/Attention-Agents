If all these options were to be selected, it would indicate an error as only one option can be chosen in a radio button group.\n\n2. `mood_impact` - Similar to the trust coverage question, this is also a radio button field, and all 5 options should be available for selection.\n\n3. `age` - This is a text input field where the user should enter their age. The validation would ensure that the entered value falls within the specified range of 18-99 years.\n\n4. `follow_by_age` - This is a select dropdown field with 5 options, and only one option can be selected.\n\n5. `employment_status` - The user should choose an option from the available list, which includes 'Student', 'Full-time', 'Part-time', 'Self-employed', and 'Not currently working'.\n\n6. `watch_time` - This is a range slider field where the user can select their daily watch time during the Olympics period. The validation should ensure that the selected value falls within the specified range of 1 to 10 hours with a step of 1 hour.\n\n7. `attention_text_mid` - This is another radio button field, and all 5 options should be available for selection.\n\n8. `country_satisfaction` - This is another range slider field where the user can select their satisfaction level with their country's Olympic performance on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\n9. `future_interest` - This is a radio button field, and all 5 options should be available for selection.\n\n10. `favorite_moment` - This is a text input field where the user can describe one memorable Olympic moment.\n\n11. The 'Next' button at the bottom of the form should be clicked to move to the next page in the survey.\n\nFor the validation checks, all fields that require only one option (radio buttons and select dropdowns) should have exactly one option selected.
