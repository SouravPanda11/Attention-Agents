      "VLM did not return JSON array. Raw:\n The image appears to be a screenshot of an online survey interface. The survey includes various question items with different interaction types, such as checkboxes, sliders, and text fields. The instructions at the top indicate that the survey has 10 answerable questions and is divided into two parts: \"Instructions\" and \"Olympic Survey.\"\n\nThe \"Instructions\" section provides a brief overview of how to complete the survey, emphasizing the need to answer all answerable items before navigating to the next page. It also mentions that there are 10 answerable questions in total.\n\nBelow the instructions, there is a list titled \"Olympic Survey,\" which seems to be the main part of the survey. This section contains several question items with their corresponding interaction types and labels. The question items include:\n\n- Checkbox for trust coverage with an option label \"Strongly disagree\" and a tool hint indicating that it is a checkbox.\n- Slider for age with a numeric input field and min/max values.\n- Dropdown menu for employment status with an option label \"Select...\" and a tool hint indicating that it is a select box.\n- Slider for watch time with a numeric input field and min/max values.\n- Checkbox for attention text mid with an option label \"Very closely\" and a tool hint indicating that it is a checkbox.\n- Slider for country satisfaction with a numeric input field and min/max values.\n- Dropdown menu for future interest with an option label \"Select...\" and a tool hint indicating that it is a select box.\n- Text field for favorite moment with a label asking the respondent to briefly describe one memorable Olympic moment.\n- Checkbox for mood impact with an option label \"Strongly disagree\" and a tool hint indicating that it is a checkbox.\n\nThe screenshot also shows the \"next\" button, which suggests that there might be more pages to the survey beyond what's visible in this image. The overall layout of the interface is typical for online surveys, with each question item clearly marked and organized to facilitate easy navigation and response entry. ",
